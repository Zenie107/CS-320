question,option1,option2,option3,option4,correctIndex,explanation
Which 'pillar' of reproducibility is violated if requirements.txt is missing?,Environment isolation,Data provenance,Algorithmic transparency,Bit-level stability,0,"Libraries change over time; a requirements file locks versions to ensure the environment stays consistent across different machines."
To ensure another student gets the exact same random dataset you must:,Run on the same CPU,Use global variables,Set a fixed integer as a random seed,Use a CSPRNG,2,"Pseudo-random number generators are deterministic algorithms; starting with the same 'seed' ensures the output sequence is identical every time."
Which scenario prevents the Garbage Collector from reclaiming memory?,Object in a finished function,Object in a cleared list,Object in an uncleared reference cycle,Object is a small integer,2,"Standard reference counting cannot detect cycles (where A points to B and B points to A). Python's cyclic garbage collector is needed to break these."
Why is a pandas DataFrame often larger in RAM than its CSV file?,Double storage in RAM,Metadata overhead per element,Automatic data compression,OS speculative allocation,1,"CSVs are raw text; DataFrames are complex objects that store extra metadata, type information, and pointers for every single data point."
Which command suggests that the garbage collector run immediately?,mem.free(),del all,sys.exit(),gc.collect(),3,"While 'del' removes a reference, 'gc.collect()' explicitly tells the Python interpreter to search for and reclaim unreachable memory immediately."
In the 'Memory Hierarchy' which is fastest but most limited?,L3 Cache,RAM,CPU Registers,SSD,2,"Registers are located directly inside the CPU. They have the lowest latency (fastest) but can only hold a few bytes of data at a time."
Why are absolute file paths (C:\Users\...) a threat to reproducibility?,They consume more RAM,They are machine-specific and break elsewhere,Python cannot read 'Users' folders,They slow down I/O operations,1,"Hard-coded paths assume a specific user's folder structure. Using relative paths (e.g., './data/') makes the project portable."
What is the primary difference between Shallow and Deep Copy?,Deep copy is only for strings,Deep copy duplicates nested objects,Shallow copy deletes the original,Deep copy is automatic,1,"A shallow copy only copies the outer container; a deep copy recursively duplicates every object found inside the container."
Why is Reference Counting alone insufficient for Python?,It is too expensive,It only works for local variables,It doesn't work on 64-bit,It cannot clean up circular references,3,"If two objects point to each other but are no longer connected to the main program, their reference count remains at 1, causing a memory leak."
Which tool packages the OS environment and libraries together?,Git,Pyenv,Docker,CSV,2,"Docker uses containerization to wrap the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries into one package, ensuring it runs the same everywhere."
